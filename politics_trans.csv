0,Krieg gegen die Ukraine: So ist die Lage,https://www.nordbayern.de/politik/krieg-gegen-die-ukraine-so-ist-die-lage-1.13120234,"Kiev - The Ukrainian leader wants a much needed victory of democracy against tyranny. The Kremlin, in turn, is preparing for a long war. The news at a glance. Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, after his participation in the World Virtual Summit for Democracy, stressed that democracy needed a victory as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, Russia is preparing for a long war against Ukraine and the West. ""And we all - Ukrainians, all Europeans, our American allies, our friends on all continents - in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Australia - will do everything to bring this victory closer,"" Selenskyy said yesterday in his evening video address. ""The victory of Ukraine, the victory of freedom, the victory for the rule-based international order."" The US hosted the virtual summit together with Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia. US President Joe Biden had already invited to a virtual meeting of this kind in December 2021. Selenskyj underlined Biden's leading role in consolidating the democratic world. ""And this unity, as we see, is enough to fight for freedom,"" he said. ""But to win the fight against tyranny, we need more unity."" Russia is preparing for a long war with the West around Ukraine, according to Kremlin figures. ""This is a confrontation with hostile states, with unfriendly countries, this is a hybrid war that they have launched against our country. That's for a long time,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov yesterday. ""Here we need toughness, self-convincing, determination and unity around the president."" According to their spokesman Yuri Hinat, the Ukrainian air force needs ""peering"" modern combat aircraft. ""We are not helped by Polish or Czech Migs, as well as Mirages or Tornadoes,"" said Hinat on Ukrainian television on Wednesday. While the migrants received from the neighbours were welcome and necessary reinforcements, Ukraine needed multi-purpose fighter aircraft of the fourth generation, such as the American F-16. Since training pilots and ground personnel on these machines was ""no simple process"", a decision would be needed ""as far as possible yesterday"". Spain wants to supply Ukraine with ten leopard tanks of the older type 2A4, but excludes the deployment of fighter jets. The first six tanks will be delivered in two weeks, said Defense Minister Margarita Robles on Wednesday. After repeated Russian attacks with so-called Kamikaze drones on Ukrainian cities, the Ukrainian military wants to pay back with the same coin. The Secretary of the National Security Council of Ukraine, Olexij Danilov, announced counterattacks with his own drones, which, according to his words, are summarized in a ""Ukrainian swarm of Mathias Rust"" in memory of the German Kremlin flyer. There are already ""several thousand drones with a range of up to 3000 kilometres"", Danilow claimed on Twitter. The German private pilot Mathias Rust was born on 28 August 1895. On May 1, 1987, Cessna landed on the Moskwa Bridge in front of the Kremlin. He had previously taken off in Finland and had subfloated the entire Soviet air defense. Rust wanted to demonstrate with his action for world peace. His flight was followed by a wave of cleansing in the leadership of the Soviet military. The Ukrainian military leadership admitted a Russian partial success in the battles for the city of Bachmut in the east of the country on Wednesday. ""In the sector of Bachmut, the enemy continued its attacks on the city, partly with success,"" the General Staff in Kiev reported in its daily situation report. Details about Russian land gains were not mentioned. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maljar gave more concrete insights into the losses of the armed forces for the first time. According to this, the numbers of the dead on the Russian side are significantly higher than on the Ukrainian side. ""There are days in the East where the ratio of the loss (death victim) is 1 to 10,"" she told Telegram yesterday. ""Of course, this is not the case every day, and the average ratio is lower, but still."" The Ukrainian military has not yet reported its own losses since the beginning of the war more than a year ago. On the other hand, a daily statistics with the alleged losses of the Russian military are published. Thus, the Russian forces have more than 172,000 deaths to date. The Russian military, for its part, does not provide any information on its own losses. British Defense Minister Ben Wallace estimated Russian casualties and wounded on Wednesday at around 220,000, as Sky News reported.",2023-03-30 12:43:47,,nordbayern,['politics']
