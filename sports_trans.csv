In the beginning, it was already clear that both teams wanted to play for victory despite the match-off result. However, goal chances were waiting for the time being. The first setback of the match was due to Arsenal, as the captain and clockwoman Little had to be replaced early after a duel with Zadrazil. Wubben-Moy was in the game for the injured midfielders. After this personal shock, the Gunners showed the right reaction and took over the game from the time.

Williamson was the first to play the game, and the first to play the game was Manuum. 18 meters, half-right position directly searched for the finish and the ball slid into the upper long goal – a dream goal! This goal was also a hit for the Munich game. The Bayern had no control of the game at this stage and the game was increasingly hectic. Arsenal knew how to use this and scored only six minutes after Blackstenius' lead goal on the second hit of the evening. McCabe was given the ball on the left side and then flanked the Munich Sixteen. The Swede won the ball in the headball duel against Kumagai and sunk the ball to 2:0. FC Bayern then continued to have problems to raise their own game and came only in the 33rd season. Game minute by Kett to the first own goalchance. However, the 18-year-old clearly missed the Arsenal Gate with her graduation. Despite further possibilities for the Gunners, the Munich women Playful upbringing is not rewarded Even if FC Bayern was playfully inferior in the first half, Bayern coach Alexander Straus for the time being did not want to change staff. Accordingly, the game was also unchanged at first: Arsenal was the game-determining and Bavaria was looking for solutions. Despite the playful superiority of Arsenal, FC Bayern fought back into the game after an hour of playing and came by Klara Bühl and Lina Magulll to two promising goals. Bühl first drifted over the right side into the AFC penalty room and finished. However, Wubben-Moy was able to block her finals at the last second. After a corner ball, Magull finished with a head. Due to the gap, the Munich women absolutely needed a hit to achieve at least the extension. Thus Bayern-Coach Straus switched to three-track and brought another striker with Damnjanovic, who came into the game for Kett. With this more offensive orientation, the Bayern were also more vulnerable to counter-stakes of FC Arsenal. So also in the 73. The Gunners played for the first minute of the game, and then Fjord appeared in front of Grohs, a former F.C.B. The final quarter of an hour was largely uneventful and was marked by interruptions. On the side of FC Arsenal there were many small injury breaks, which made a playful upswing of the Munich women almost impossible. The seven-minute replay was also symbolic of these many interruptions. However, the Bayern did not come dangerously before the opponent goal in these last minutes, so it remained at the end of the 0-2 for the FC Arsenal. This defeat marks the end of this year's UWCL trip in the quarter finals for the Munich women.
