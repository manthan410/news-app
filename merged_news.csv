However, this does not mean that prices are falling. Because: The inflation refers to the price change compared to the same month of the previous year. But already in March 2022 prices have been on the rise with the outbreak of the Ukraine war. However, inflation could continue to fall during the year. Inflation in Germany is cooling down significantly. According to provisional results of the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), it was 7.4 percent in March. Compared to February (8.7%), this decline is 1.3 percentage points. This weakens the price of inflation. However, this does not mean that prices are falling again. On the contrary. Why is that? Read also Monthly interest rate report: Saving with fixed and daily money in March is especially worthwhile with these banks Monthly inflation always shows the price change compared to the same month of the previous year. Now means quite concrete: Prices are now 7.4 percent higher than those of March 2022. So compared to the month when the war in Ukraine was raging. Even then, prices have risen. In March 2022, the inflation rate was already 7.3 percent. The current inflation comes on top again, so to speak. Economists call this the basic effect. Even if the number of indicators of inflation is falling, price pressure remains high. Energy prices drive inflation up The fact that inflation has so increased was due to supply chain bottlenecks. The more powerful influence, however, is likely to be the rapidly rising energy prices. Because this also increases the cost of production and transport of other things, for which consumers ultimately pay.

Prof. Hans-Werner Sinn strongly advocates a rapid change in the accounting rules. Munich - Silicon Valley Bank's bankruptcy, which had collected deposits from start-ups and invested them in securities, recalls the so-called founder crash of 1873, which had originated from German-speaking countries and had spread across the world. The main start-ups at the time were manufacturing, e.g. from the fields of railway, electrical and chemical. But many new banks and financial companies could also be driven by the flood. Indeed, it was such companies that had been out of hand after the bursting of a huge economic bubble and had caused a banking crisis. In response to the crisis, Germany has had an important reform of the balance sheet law, which could be groundbreaking even today. Under the protection of the stock law, which exempts the company founder from private liability, the German and the Austro-Hungarian empires were in the second half of the 19th century. In the early 20th century, many new investment banks were founded to collect deposits to acquire securities. The resulting stock market upturn ultimately proved to be an economic bubble. The bubble burst in May of 1873, a few days after the Austrian Creditanstalt, the then most important bank in Austria-Hungary, had separated itself from a very large portfolio of securities due to the emergence of bankruptcy in the country. The crash on ""Black Friday"" of 9 December. The result was a wave of bankruptcy and bankruptcy. In Austria-Hungary and Germany, a significant part of the newly founded public limited companies in the financial sector went bankrupt. Adele Spitzeneders Bank, which operated exactly the same business as Charles Ponzi or Bernard L. Meadows in the USA, only represents the windy business of many new financial institutions of those days. Laxe Central Banks' Interest Policy Leads to a Valuation Bubble The parallels to today's crisis are, of course, limited, because history never repeats itself exactly, as we know. Indeed, the new banking crisis was not only created by an irrational exaggeration of markets, but also by the foreseeable consequences of a valuation bubble that had arisen as a result of the central banks' zero and negative interest rates policy. The unprecedented expansion of money, which the central banks generated by buying government securities, had generated fantastic gains for a decade in the value of older government securities already on the market and in shares. These increases in value attracted more and more investors. Following the pandemic and a plentiful government debt, a very strong inflation was created, which central banks want to take the power of a drastic turnaround in interest rates. The previously inflated market values of long-term securities collapsed. This broke the neck of Silicon Valley Bank and a few days later Credit Suisse, one of the largest banks in the world. In the USA, as in Germany, the valuation of plants contributed to market values (mark-to-market or fair value principle) for overheating and bubble formation. This valuation method made the balance sheets volatile and strengthened the cycles. In the upswing, value increases are generated on the investments of companies, which are calculated to suggest the growth of equity. The growing stock of equity in the balance sheet suggests an increasing creditworthiness of companies, which enables them to take deposits and loans in order to pay dividends. The size of the dividends is, of course, lacking in equity when the bubble bursts and the values of the investments return to normal. The ups and downs of the courses systematically lead to the erosion of the companies and thus increases the risk of bankruptcy. Banks: Privatisation of profits, socialisation of losses In association with the limitation of liability of public limited companies, the Mark-to-Market principle also encourages financial companies to venture overly risky business models. In the hope of rising prices, they acquire bonds and other financial products in the upswing. If the expected profits are expected, they will be distributed to shareholders. And when the bubble bursts, in the worst case, you lose only the little equity with which you could operate thanks to a lax regulation. Today, people are also rightly hoping to be saved from bankruptcy by state bail-out actions. The privatisation of profits in the construction of the bubble and socialization or at least the relocation of losses to third parties in their places creates a business profit over time even if a real economic profit was not achieved. Germany had reacted in 1874 to the casino capitalism generated by the Mark-to-Market method by introducing the low-value principle into its balance sheet law (see below). Sinn, Casino Capitalism, Oxford University Press 2010, Chapters 5 and 7). This principle requires companies to always choose the lowest possible value approach for their assets: either the current market value or the historical purchase value, which is always lower. The low-value principle has led to companies having quiet reserves in their balance sheets after an upswing, which have helped to cushion losses in the downturn. It has basically provided German banking with a high degree of stability. Low Value Principle contra Casino Capitalism The low value principle in German commercial law still applies to public limited companies and other corporations not traded on stock exchanges. However, EU decisions for corporations since 2004 have gradually replaced it with the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) rules with its mark-to-market method. In the US and many other Western countries, the Mark-to-Market or Fair Value method is generally considered to be the central element of the General Accounting Guidelines (GAAP) for all types of companies. Re-examine accounting rules urgently In view of the new start-up crisis, it is advisable to replace the valuation method based on market values with the lower value principle. At the same time, measures could be taken to strengthen the publicly identified equity. Consideration should be given to referring to the minimum regulatory capital ratios rather than to the sum of risk-weighted assets to the simple balance sheet total. Risk-weighted assets are usually only a fraction of the real balance sheet total, as many investments are only very insufficiently recorded. This is how the Government securities are not included at all, although they have proved to be particularly vulnerable to interest rate risk in the current crisis. Casino capitalism would thus be deprived of its ground. Financial crises would be more unlikely to be affected by such reforms and less often countries would see themselves in the process of expensive bail-out actions. Economic development was smoother and more sustainable. The defenders of the market economy would be more easily persuaded by their critics of the blessings of this economic form.

In addition, the federal states had to fulfil their enforcement tasks, sanction violations and ensure that the law was taken seriously.

In a representative Forsa survey on behalf of the association, 86 percent of the respondents would have indicated that they would normally use disposable boxes for food to take away. When asked why reusable use is not possible, 72 percent said that there was a lack of an offer, and 27 percent said they did not want to carry or store the boxes. 55 percent said they were important for a low price or a small deposit.

What will apply to gas and oil heating in the future. Berlin – For almost three days, the ruling parties of the traffic lights coalition have discussed. Late Tuesday evening (28th. The agreement finally reached important decisions for the future of Germany. The recent criticism was mainly caused by the heating plans of Minister of Economics Robert Habeck (Greens). New heating requirements: Sharper rules for new heating systems Long was a ban on gas and oil heating systems in the room. For many homeowners a huge financial hurdle. Finally, the conversion to climate-friendly heating methods, such as heat pumps, is usually associated with high costs. But now homeowners can breathe. In the coalition decision, SPD, Greens and FDP have now significantly relaxed the guidelines. The paper says literally: ""The energy transition in the heat sector is a key area for achieving climate policy goals and for a further reduction in dependence on fossil raw materials. A quick re-control in the area of building heat is a central building block. January 2024 every newly installed heating system is operated to 65 percent with renewable energies. Social aspects are also to be taken into account, according to the result paper. ""No one is let down. "" This should also apply to tenants. Finally, it would be obvious that landlords will transfer the cost of a new heating to the tenants. To this end, the exchange of oil and gas heating systems will be examined. The money for this is to come from the Climate and Transformation Fund. This is not part of the federal budget. However, there is nothing to be read in the paper about a new obligation to exchange and a ban on oil and gas heaters still running. So if you are still running a functioning heating system with fossil raw materials, you probably don't have to expect to have to replace them with a heat pump or something like that in a timely manner. The draft law on the new heating rules is to be launched in April, so that the law can be adopted in the Bundestag before the summer break.

6,3000 Euro Rente: Wie geht das?,https://www.hna.de/wirtschaft/rente-rentenversicherung-rentner-3000-euro-deutschland-wer-kriegt-das-92178663.html?cmp=defrss,"Can you get a pension of 3,000 euros or more in Germany? This works - but the hurdles are extremely high. Frankfurt am Main - In Germany, pensioners have difficulty getting legal retirement income of more than 3,000 euros. That's what the FAZ calculated. According to this, only 50 pensioners in Germany receive a pension of more than 3,000 euros - legally well-considered. The German pension insurance company did not want to confirm this on demand, writes the paper on. The German government's pension insurance report only shows that 50 cases are very likely to have more than 3,000 euros of pension. The official graduation of pension insurance only goes up to 2,400 euros per month. The insurance may not say how much the highest pensioner in Germany gets. ""But it is a good thing that at present only 0.6 percent of pensioners have more than 2,400 euros of pay-out per month. So one out of 160. And there are taxes and health insurance not even deducted, it continues. How do you get a pension of 3,000 euros? And how does the pension count? Well, this year for around 43,000 euros of gross annual income – that is the German ""average wage"" – a pay point. This is currently about 36 euros pension value contributions to be collected up to an annual income of 87,600 euros per year (converted 7300 euros per month). Those who do this get a good two pay points per year. Anyone who has always earned 45 years at the upper limit will receive a good 90 pay points and thus more than 3200 euros in pension. The fact that statutory pension insurance is a reliable protection for old age, said recently DRV President Gundula Roßbach in an interview with Merkur in Munich.

The negotiations are considered to have failed. Munich – For three days, the talks between trade unions and employers were held, which had been initiated by a comprehensive warning strike on Monday. On Thursday night, Verdi and the Dbb civil service declared the negotiations for the civil service of the federal and state governments failed. Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser announced for the employers: ""We are now convoking the conciliation. In the time until then, even smaller regional warning strikes are planned. After strike on Monday – collective bargaining failed: Conciliation Commission starts work By mid-April, a conciliation commission has now time to present a proposal for an agreement on the income of the 2.5 million employees of the federal and local authorities, which excludes strikes in the two weeks before Easter. The former Saxon Prime Minister Georg Milbradt and the former Bremen State Councillor Hans-Henning Lühr are the chairmen of the employers' side. Lühr would have the decisive voice in case of doubt. After the negotiations declared to have failed, which had been held in three rounds since January, Verdi boss Frank Werneke said: ""In the end we had to find that the differences were not bridgeable. Both said that the union bodies unanimously voted for the failure. Faeser on collective bargaining in Germany: ""Faser and her SPD Party-College and Lord Mayor Gelsenkirchens, Karin Welge, who acted as the negotiator of the municipalities, were disappointed to reach the limit of the responsible person. ""I am very sorry that the trade unions have now broken off the negotiations,"" the Minister of the Interior stressed, ""We would have liked to see something different, and I believe that it would have been good to stay at the negotiating table in these times of crisis."" She further said that employers ""have reached the limits of the responsible person for public budgets."" ""The bridge we have struck is not one that one could not have made, Welge made clear. Now be written ""the disappointment in their face."" According to Faeser, the employer's offer was as follows: eight percent more income and a minimum amount of 300 euros – in addition, a tax-free one-off payment of 3000 euros with a payout of 1750 euros already in May. Faeser pointed out the possibility of helping employees quickly – especially since the costs are very high right now: ""And I think that would have been in the interest of the employees to have a quick solution now."" Verdi and dbb's demand was 10.5 percent more wages, at least 500 euros a month. The minimum amount which would benefit mainly those who receive lower incomes was central. Collective bargaining for 2.5 million people: both sides were ready to compromise In February, employers had offered five percent more wages and one-off payments of 1500 and then another 1000 euros. A minimum amount was not provided for. Employers said that the at least 300 euros now offered in lower income groups had increased by up to 15 percent. There is also disagreement over the duration. The unions are demanding twelve months, which is too little for employers. They had offered 27 months at first. It is said from negotiating circles that both sides were prepared to compromise. Silberbach noted that, given the general position of employers, the unions' acceptance of the term was not sufficient for an overall solution. Collective dispute: Extensive strikes in second half of April are possible again It is completely open how things continue after conciliation. After the unions, which are available to the German Press Agency (dpa), have been established, the date of the first publication is 18 June. The negotiations of the collective bargaining parties will be resumed on April 20. Then there can be a solution, as are other regular strikes. Already in the early 1990s, strikes were held in the public service after a failed conciliation – then for more than ten days and nationwide. In the past few weeks, Verdi had temporarily paralyzed public transport, day care, clinics and many other areas. Werneke said of ""half a million participants"" by the end of last week, which underlined the great support. ""This support is unbroken,"" the Verdi Chairman warned. The union has registered more than 70,000 entries in the last three months. The collective bargaining is about the payment of members of a number of professions, including educators, bus drivers, employees of baths, firefighters, nurses, administrative staff, senior nurses, sewage workers, foresters and doctors. The income of over 2.4 million collective workers of municipal employers and 134,000 of the federal government is to be adjusted. The unions want the result to be transferred to officials.

Now he got the Heinrich Mann Prize. The writer György Dalos 2017 ""For, against and without communism: The title under which he published his memories in 2019 refers to an ideologically moving life. Always a piece ahead of real change, Dalos also reflects the recent history of his home country, about which he has repeatedly written in novels and essays. Now Dalos was awarded the award, which was handed to him on Tuesday evening at the Academy of Arts (AdK); in Berlin, where the 79-year-old has lived for many years. Dalos, born in Budapest in 1943, grew up in poverty, hunger as a constant companion. He said to the German radio that he had made him a victim of communism when he was given enough food in a state lung sanatorium for the first time. Dalos studied history in Moscow, then returned to Hungary, where he was arrested in 1968 for Maoist activity. The Jewish writer was one of the founders of the Hungarian opposition movement, with a ban on his profession. No Coquettishness Unlike many West German intellectuals, Dalos never coquetted with his ""maoist confusions"", says writer Marko Martin, who holds the laudation in the AdK on Dalos. He also tells of his prison days and hunger strike with precision, without exaggeration, always with ""the saving side-stroke on the absurd detail"". The Heinrich Mann Prize is awarded to Dalos for his essayist work, but without the literature, Martin says, he is not the first to explain: ""How about Dalos without Tamás Cohen?, Cohen, the charming novelist from ""Die Seikeschaften"" and ""Der Verhinderspieler"", grows up practically without parents like Dalos. Politically instructed by his party-faithful uncle Dani, he first gets together with him when he is working for a school friend. His father was an officer under the authoritarian Admiral Miklós Horthy, who was responsible for the decree of anti-Jewish laws in Hungary and thus ultimately for the expulsion of the Jews from the country. Like Dalos, Cohen later belongs to the opposition and eventually emigrates to West Berlin. "" The company Tamás Cohen is surrounded by a broken society,"" Martin says. Dalos uses similar words today. In his short thank-you speech, he speaks of a ""world out of the way in which he lives"", meaning ""the war of destruction, which was attenuated as a military operation,"" Russia against Ukraine. In Hungary, the relationship with the head of government of the successor state of the Soviet Union is maintained. Gergely Gulyás, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's spokesman for government, recently said that Hungary would ignore the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court against Vladimir Putin, betraying this Hungarian territory. The European Union also refrained from placing Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, on the sanction list, as Hungary protested. Dalos, who openly calls the Hungarian government illiberal, wrote a book about the ""Orbán"" system last year. Other texts of the writer and historian the Russian German or the Tsar family Romanov. It is a pity that texts from Dalos are not read this evening, but are remembered only by the name of the prize, with an excerpt from Heinrich Mann's ""Professor Unrat"" written by the author. The forced withdrawal from the Academy of Arts in 1933 is remembered by the writer and vice president of the AdK, Kathrin Röggla, in a welcoming speech. Professor Unrat György Dalos has a special relationship with Mann's ""Professor Unrat"". Just started, the novel was immediately taken away from him when his geography teacher caught him reading in class, he tells. Years later he got in touch with the material again when he worked on a biography of Marlene Dietrich, who played the leading role in the UFA novel ""Der blaue Engel"" (The Blue Angel). The book was never published. The publisher, says Dalos, broke shortly before.",2023-03-30 07:32:00,https://taz.de/picture/6179872/948/32499005-1.jpeg,taz,"['entertainment', 'environment']",

17,Krieg gegen die Ukraine: So ist die Lage,https://www.nordbayern.de/politik/krieg-gegen-die-ukraine-so-ist-die-lage-1.13120234,"Kiev - The Ukrainian leader wants a much needed victory of democracy against tyranny. The Kremlin, in turn, is preparing for a long war. The news at a glance. Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, after his participation in the World Virtual Summit for Democracy, stressed that democracy needed a victory as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, Russia is preparing for a long war against Ukraine and the West. ""And we all - Ukrainians, all Europeans, our American allies, our friends on all continents - in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Australia - will do everything to bring this victory closer,"" Selenskyy said yesterday in his evening video address. ""The victory of Ukraine, the victory of freedom, the victory for the rule-based international order."" The US hosted the virtual summit together with Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia. US President Joe Biden had already invited to a virtual meeting of this kind in December 2021. Selenskyj underlined Biden's leading role in consolidating the democratic world. ""And this unity, as we see, is enough to fight for freedom,"" he said. ""But to win the fight against tyranny, we need more unity."" Russia is preparing for a long war with the West around Ukraine, according to Kremlin figures. ""This is a confrontation with hostile states, with unfriendly countries, this is a hybrid war that they have launched against our country. That's for a long time,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov yesterday. ""Here we need toughness, self-convincing, determination and unity around the president."" According to their spokesman Yuri Hinat, the Ukrainian air force needs ""peering"" modern combat aircraft. ""We are not helped by Polish or Czech Migs, as well as Mirages or Tornadoes,"" said Hinat on Ukrainian television on Wednesday. While the migrants received from the neighbours were welcome and necessary reinforcements, Ukraine needed multi-purpose fighter aircraft of the fourth generation, such as the American F-16. Since training pilots and ground personnel on these machines was ""no simple process"", a decision would be needed ""as far as possible yesterday"". Spain wants to supply Ukraine with ten leopard tanks of the older type 2A4, but excludes the deployment of fighter jets. The first six tanks will be delivered in two weeks, said Defense Minister Margarita Robles on Wednesday. After repeated Russian attacks with so-called Kamikaze drones on Ukrainian cities, the Ukrainian military wants to pay back with the same coin. The Secretary of the National Security Council of Ukraine, Olexij Danilov, announced counterattacks with his own drones, which, according to his words, are summarized in a ""Ukrainian swarm of Mathias Rust"" in memory of the German Kremlin flyer. There are already ""several thousand drones with a range of up to 3000 kilometres"", Danilow claimed on Twitter. The German private pilot Mathias Rust was born on 28 August 1895. On May 1, 1987, Cessna landed on the Moskwa Bridge in front of the Kremlin. He had previously taken off in Finland and had subfloated the entire Soviet air defense. Rust wanted to demonstrate with his action for world peace. His flight was followed by a wave of cleansing in the leadership of the Soviet military. The Ukrainian military leadership admitted a Russian partial success in the battles for the city of Bachmut in the east of the country on Wednesday. ""In the sector of Bachmut, the enemy continued its attacks on the city, partly with success,"" the General Staff in Kiev reported in its daily situation report. Details about Russian land gains were not mentioned. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maljar gave more concrete insights into the losses of the armed forces for the first time. According to this, the numbers of the dead on the Russian side are significantly higher than on the Ukrainian side. ""There are days in the East where the ratio of the loss (death victim) is 1 to 10,"" she told Telegram yesterday. ""Of course, this is not the case every day, and the average ratio is lower, but still."" The Ukrainian military has not yet reported its own losses since the beginning of the war more than a year ago. On the other hand, a daily statistics with the alleged losses of the Russian military are published. Thus, the Russian forces have more than 172,000 deaths to date. The Russian military, for its part, does not provide any information on its own losses. British Defense Minister Ben Wallace estimated Russian casualties and wounded on Wednesday at around 220,000, as Sky News reported.",2023-03-30 12:43:47,,nordbayern,['politics'],

On Wednesday evening FC Bayern women were 0:2 (0:2) at FC Arsenal. Despite the success of the match last week, the Bayern-Coach team Alexander Straus missed the jump among the best four teams in Europe. In the UWCL quarter-elfinal rematch, Bayern coach Alexander Straus changed his team to two positions. In the first round of the season, Lea Schüller returned to the starting team, replacing Jovana Damnjanovic. The Norwegian also gave the confidence of 18-year-old Franziska Kett, who started in the offensive series for Sydney Lohmann. Positions: Arsenal FC: Zinsberger – Maritz, Williamson, Rafaelle, McCabe – Little, Maanum, Wälti – Pelova, Foord, Blackstenius FC Bayern: Grohs – Rall, Viggosdottir, Kumagai, Hansen – Zadrazil, Stanway – Kett, Magul, Bühl – Schüller With a delay in the break In the London rain, the more than 20,000 spectators at Emirates Stadium saw a balanced start to the game of both teams. In the beginning, it was already clear that both teams wanted to play for victory despite the match-off result. However, goal chances were waiting for the time being. The first setback of the match was due to Arsenal, as the captain and clockwoman Little had to be replaced early after a duel with Zadrazil. Wubben-Moy was in the game for the injured midfielders. After this personal shock, the Gunners showed the right reaction and took over the game from the time. The London women forced the Straus-Elf to lose their balls again and again, which were in the 19th century. ==References====External links==* Official website And so it happened: Hansen played a mispass in his own build-up game, so Arsenal could quickly switch. Williamson was the first to play the game, and the first to play the game was Manuum. 18 meters, half-right position directly searched for the finish and the ball slid into the upper long goal – a dream goal! This goal was also a hit for the Munich game. The Bayern had no control of the game at this stage and the game was increasingly hectic. Arsenal knew how to use this and scored only six minutes after Blackstenius' lead goal on the second hit of the evening. McCabe was given the ball on the left side and then flanked the Munich Sixteen. The Swede won the ball in the headball duel against Kumagai and sunk the ball to 2:0. FC Bayern then continued to have problems to raise their own game and came only in the 33rd season. Game minute by Kett to the first own goalchance. However, the 18-year-old clearly missed the Arsenal Gate with her graduation. Despite further possibilities for the Gunners, the Munich women Playful upbringing is not rewarded Even if FC Bayern was playfully inferior in the first half, Bayern coach Alexander Straus for the time being did not want to change staff. Accordingly, the game was also unchanged at first: Arsenal was the game-determining and Bavaria was looking for solutions. Despite the playful superiority of Arsenal, FC Bayern fought back into the game after an hour of playing and came by Klara Bühl and Lina Magulll to two promising goals. Bühl first drifted over the right side into the AFC penalty room and finished. However, Wubben-Moy was able to block her finals at the last second. After a corner ball, Magull finished with a head. Due to the gap, the Munich women absolutely needed a hit to achieve at least the extension. Thus Bayern-Coach Straus switched to three-track and brought another striker with Damnjanovic, who came into the game for Kett. With this more offensive orientation, the Bayern were also more vulnerable to counter-stakes of FC Arsenal. So also in the 73. The Gunners played for the first minute of the game, and then Fjord appeared in front of Grohs, a former F.C.B. The final quarter of an hour was largely uneventful and was marked by interruptions. On the side of FC Arsenal there were many small injury breaks, which made a playful upswing of the Munich women almost impossible. The seven-minute replay was also symbolic of these many interruptions. However, the Bayern did not come dangerously before the opponent goal in these last minutes, so it remained at the end of the 0-2 for the FC Arsenal. This defeat marks the end of this year's UWCL trip in the quarter finals for the Munich women. Off-season match in Meppen After this bitter departure in the UEFA Women's Champions League, Bayern Women now have to look forward to the next round. The team of Bayern-Coach Alexander Straus is a guest at the SV Meppen at the end of the English week before they then enter the national team break.

25,Stiftung Warentest testet Akku-Rasenmäher: Drei sind „mangelhaft“,https://www.inside-digital.de/news/stiftung-warentest-testet-akku-rasenmaeher-drei-sind-mangelhaft,"Battery lawnmowers are incredibly practical helpers in the garden. No disturbing power cable, no stinking exhaust gases and a pleasantly quiet working method characterize the battery-powered mowers. Disadvantage: They are usually quite expensive apart from offers at Lidl and Aldi. And sometimes they are even deficient in quality. This is the result of a new test by the Stiftung Warentest ( ""test"" edition: 4/2023 ). Three cordless lawnmowers failed with ""deficient"" – including a model from Bosch. Only four out of twelve models tested received a ""good"" one. In the test, battery lawnmowers from different price ranges had to prove what they could do. And of course, how safe they are and how long the supplied battery lasts. It was discovered that the recently tested models can master lawn areas between 200 and 600 square meters with a battery charge. Sounds good, but is sometimes less than promised by manufacturers. The longest time to go was the relatively cheap Metabo RM 36-18 LTX BL 36 (from 156 euros) and the spindle mower Einhell GE-HM 18/38 Li Solo (from 120 euros). And the Bosch Universal Rotak 36-550 (from 319 euros) also impressed in the range test. The cut result of this mower was also consistently good. The safety even rated the testers as very good. The Bosch mower, however, was the only cordless lawnmower to fail in the test with regard to mechanical durability, because it did not last in the shake test. This caused a devaluation and in the final statement for a ""inadequacy"". According to Stiftung Warentest, the Alpina AL1 3820 Li Kit and Einhell Rasarro 36/38 are not recommended. In the Alpina mower, the testers found the probably carcinogenic substance naphthalene in the grip of the catch basket. Equally unpleasant were the testers of the product, which were found in the handle of the Einhell-Mäher, which classified health-threatening plasticizers. In addition, the single-light mower failed through the safety test. Simulated stones ripped holes into the catch basket. In contrast, the test of the Stiftung Warentest was convincing as a test winner with a ""gut"" of the Stihl RMA 443 C. The mower result was best for this battery lawn mower. This mower was also the most expensive in this year's test. Currently it is in the best case to have for 425 euros. The Stiftung Warentest also issued a ""good"" award-winning Stiga Combi 340e Kit (from 329 euros) and the Husqvarna LC 137i (from 399 euros). The single-hell spindle mower, which is convincing in the battery test, also achieved a ""good"" in the final calculation. About our links With these symbols we identify partner links.

The app had started with great ambitions and a good concept. One wanted to break up with tens of different apps, which are sometimes necessary for the operation of all smart devices at home. The goal should be to create a link between different manufacturers in an app, thus enabling a smart home where the devices can communicate with each other. The whole thing was done via the app and the cloud servers of Home Connect Plus. In particular, beginners who did not want to struggle with often complicated Raspberry PI solutions were targeted. But now the end. ==References== On June 15, an app will be made available to allow users to download all the data they have provided or created. This could be a list of rooms, automations and free services in addition to personal data. What you should do with the data then remains unclear. The provider says: ""However, we would like to point out that Home Connect Plus automations are specific to the Home Connect Plus app and cannot be used by another Smart Home app. A similar service, Conrad Connect, had already painted the sails some time ago. The only solution that is half-like is the Telekom's smart home system, which has also been relying on an app for networking for some time. However, many components are not supported here. Home Connect Plus had convinced many companies of its system. Since the launch a little less than two years ago, you have been able to connect Sonos and AVM as much as Homematic IP, Hue, Somfy, Gardena and Ledvance. And of course, Bosch and Siemens' household appliances were also present, from their home Connect Plus environment. The own Home Connect app is continued, they told. As to the reasons for the recruitment, it is said that, in view of ""the difficult economic situation,"" it was decided not to continue the investment in Home Connect Plus. It is possible that the introduction of Matter also plays a role in the considerations. The new Matter standard is designed to enable a wide range of devices to be connected offline and thus to create a smart home. But the introduction is currently more difficult than expected. Just now Hue has moved his Matter update.",2023-03-30 11:30:00,,inside-digital,['technology'],
27,Spotify: Neue Funktion verärgert unzählige Kunden,https://www.inside-digital.de/news/spotify-neue-funktion-veraergert-unzaehlige-kunden,"The short video app TikTok is incredibly successful. So it is no wonder that other platforms like Instagram or YouTube are increasingly relying on short videos in portrait format. The makers of Spotify have probably followed this trend and thought ""Why should we still show playlists and albums to users of our music app on the start page if we can also present short videos there? However, countless users see this differently and criticism is hailing. Until now, Spotify's homepage was quite functional: Six playlists often belonged to the top and then several elements in changing order. For example, with personalized new releases, playlists to the mood or time of day, events nearby or last belonged playlists. Except for the six playlists at the top, this is all gone. Instead, you can see big videos, so-called canvas, which you know from playing songs. These apply playlists or podcasts that are supposed to fit your own taste. This not only makes much less content available, but also presents them disastrously. Even on the largest smartphone, you can only see a single ""Canvas"" and have to wipe each video individually, as the app stops with each canvas. Normal scrolling as in any other app or website is no longer possible. While the old design has invited you to discover new releases or previously unknown playlists and offer the user a variety of content on one page, the new design wipes you to death with an infinite list of playlists. Other users see this similar. In the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, there are countless reviews with 1 or 2 stars in which users criticize the new design. The new Spotify design has not yet arrived at many users. In a short sample in the office, I am the only one who has already been changed to the new design. I'm afraid you can't turn it off yourself. So let us hope that Spotify takes the criticism of users to heart and stops distribution. Personally, I have been using Spotify in the premium version since 2012 and have since spent a four-digit sum on subscription fees for the service.

28,iPhone 15: Insider erklärt Apples spannendste Veränderung,https://www.inside-digital.de/news/iphone-15-insider-erklaert-apples-spannendste-veraenderung,"A few weeks ago, the first rendering images of iPhone 15 and 15 Pro appeared. Based on CAD drawings that shell manufacturers use for their products, they gave initial indications of important changes. Since the first model, Apple's smartphone has not only side buttons that normally click as you are used to. A small switch for muting has always been available. Now Leaker ""anonymous-A.S."" spoke with further details in the MacRumors forum. These describe how the new buttons work. The same user had already predicted details about Dynamic Island last year. Remember: Apple allegedly wants to do without traditional buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro. Instead, ""Solid-State-keys"" are to be used. These are not movable, but they still recognize the pressure through your finger. Apple already uses a similar technique in the MacBook. There the trackpad is not movable, only Apple's so-called Taptic Engine provides a vibration inside the device. It feels like it's moving. The home button since iPhone 7 is based on the same idea. This technology is now also to be used for all buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro. However, there were fears that after the device is switched off – for example when the battery is empty – no key movements will be detected. Apple seems to have found a solution here. Various components of Apple's smartphone already work today even when the device is switched off. These include Bluetooth – and ultra-wideband features for the ""Where is?  These functions are to be taken over by a new chip in the iPhone 15 Pro. He is also responsible for the new keys. It also detects a pressure on the switches when the battery is empty or the iPhone 15 Pro is switched off. It is still unclear whether a vibration by the Taptic Engine takes place in the switched off state. Furthermore, it should be able to distinguish between a keystroke and holding a key. Even a variant of 3D Touch should be supported. So it is possible, for example, that a slight taping only slightly increases the volume, while a strong pressure causes large jumps. Apple is currently testing several variants of the new volume control. In addition to simple keypresses for louder and quieter, the movement of a finger is also tried out via the button for control. It is currently unclear which variant Apple will choose at the end. However, this can be controlled by the software, so Apple can adjust it at any time. Another feature since the first hour is, as mentioned above, the small lever to mute. As the leaker writes in the forum, this switch will indeed be missing the iPhone 15 Pro. A new small button should take the place above the volume control. Internally, Apple calls this an action button; the same name as the Apple Watch Ultra. You can add various functions to the Ultra version of the Apple Watch. For example, you can turn the flashlight on and off by pressing it or start a workout. But you can also put your own shortcut here. The possibilities on the iPhone could be much more extensive. In addition to mute, it is conceivable that you can also activate a focus mode by pressing the button. A template of the possibilities is perhaps the operating aid "" Tap on the back side You've been able to find this in the Settings > User Tools > Taping for a long time. What options Apple will offer is currently unknown.",2023-03-30 10:00:00,,inside-digital,['technology'],

They demanded, among other things, affordable housing and more social housing. ""Living: a right for all"" or ""A right or a privilege?"" was written on the banners of the demonstrators. They demanded a constitutional right to a home for everyone, as one of the associations said, who had called for the demonstrations. ""I live in constant fear that my landlord will announce a brutal rent increase,"" said Ana Reis da Silva, a 32-year-old lawyer who told me that she has been living in the Portuguese capital for about ten years. ""Rentes must remain affordable,"" demanded the 72-year-old retired Martinho Faias Parreira. He lives in a social housing in Lisbon, whose rent has risen sharply in recent years. 35-year-old illustrator Diogo Guerra said that he hears every day from people affected by the crisis: ""People who work and are homeless or who have to move out because their apartment is made a place of accommodation for tourists.""Lisbon is a popular place of residence for so-called digital nomads, i.e. people who can work from anywhere. In 2022, the city ranked one of the »Nomad List«, a ranking of the best cities for digital nomads worldwide. Last week, the Portuguese left government had decided to lease vacant properties in a controversial form. This is supposed to help fight housing shortages. The government of Prime Minister António Costa announced that forced rental would be possible if an apartment remained uninhabited for more than two years. According to official estimates, the country has over 700,000 vacant residential properties with a population of over 10,3 million. The measure was part of the ""Mais Habitaçao"" programme, which was announced in February and now approved by the Council of Ministers. Another government measure is a stop to the granting of so-called golden visas, which give rich investors a right of residence. This is intended to reduce the real estate speculation. According to the European Statistical Authority Eurostat, the purchase price of real estate in Portugal increased by more than 75 percent between 2010 and 2022, while rents increased by almost 25 percent. According to official data, more than half of the workers in the country earned less than 1000 euros per month last year, the minimum wage is 760 euros. Portugal is one of the poorest countries in Western Europe. At the same time, the average rent in Lisbon is 1350 euros per month, as an investigation of the housing portals Imovirtual showed.",2023-04-02 12:18:26,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/50fb7a62-4708-47d1-a775-8b3c0bf375b0_w948_r1.778_fpx57_fpy37.jpg,,,0.0

While Russia has lost up to 200,000 armed forces from injuries or death a year ago since the beginning of the war, a large number of them are due to causes other than the actual fighting, the British Ministry of Defense reported on intelligence findings. ""Russian commanders consider the widespread abuse of alcohol to be particularly detrimental to the effectiveness of the fighting.""At the beginning of the week, a Russian telegram news channel reported that there was an ""extremely high"" number of incidents, crimes and deaths related to alcohol consumption among the armed forces, it was said. Strong drinking was widespread in Russian society and accepted as a tacitly accepted part of military life, even in combat missions. Other major causes of non-combat losses were probably poor training in weapons, traffic accidents and damage caused by climatic conditions such as undercooling. Since the beginning of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the British Ministry of Defense has published daily updates on the war. The British government is therefore seeking to oppose both Russian representation and allies in the fight against intelligence.

In the campaign final sprint, she focused on traditional social democratic issues: Marin personally still has a very loyal supporter. Her »fanbase« never resented her for these recordings either: the »party video«, which was leaked last August, caused a lot of media attention, and the Prime Minister had to deal with a lot of critical questions – but for many followers, even worldwide, dance moves and Marin's presence in the social media only confirmed her image as the »coolest head of state«. Nevertheless, this man managed to bring his party Kokoomus, the National Collection Party, into a tight leadership position in the survey values. Petteri Orpo is considered a rather pale figure. His message to the voters who are faced with a recession is therefore scarce: then there is Riikka Purra, who is also well-informed in the survey values. Although she has put her party of the True Finns somewhat more in the political center, she nevertheless contested the election campaign with the topics popular for the right-wing populists: One topic where there are virtually no differences of opinion between the centre-left coalition and the opposition is the way to NATO. After Turkey has recently agreed to Finland's accession to NATO, this step will be followed soon. Then maybe under another leadership. The current Minister of Defence showed himself at least deeply relaxed in his view of the future with this video on Twitter. His successor will also be elected in the Sunday election. And for Sanna Marin, who took a very clear position, especially in the Ukraine war, it says that in the event of an electoral defeat, the candidacy for an EU top office in Brussels could soon be held.",2023-04-02 10:27:51,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 180 101' width='180' height='101' %3E%3C/svg%3E",,,3.0

Two of the prisoners have been in the Taliban's custody since January, and the duration of the third arrest was initially unclear. According to media reports, men are a medical doctor working for an aid organization and the manager of a housing facility for development workers in Kabul. The third man is said to be a traveller known on the YouTube video platform. He became known as a »danger tourist« with his travels to crisis areas and caused controversy.

In polls, three parties were almost the same in advance: the conservative National Assembly party of former Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo went on to vote as a slight favorite. They recently saw polls only minimally before the right-wing populist party The Finns and the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Sanna Marin. Until 8 p.m. (local time) the polling stations in the northernmost country of the EU are open. Immediately thereafter, a first trend based on early votes should be published. A preliminary final result could be established around midnight on the night of Monday. The 37-year-old Marin has been Finnish Prime Minister since the end of 2019. It leads a center-left coalition of five parties. She was the youngest head of government in the world when she took office. Even then, the Social Democrats were only very marginally the strongest force in the parliamentary elections. Those who ultimately become the strongest force were completely open before the election Sunday: Orpos Conservatives came to 19.8 percent of the votes in the last pre-election survey of the Finnish radio station Yle, the Finn Party for its chairman Riikka Purra to 19.5 percent and Marin's Social Democrats to 18.7 percent. The leader of the party with the most votes is traditionally the first to have the chance to form a new government in Finland. However, long and tough coalition negotiations are expected, as several parties have excluded cooperation with the right-wing populists.

Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyy spoke of an ""absurd and destructive"" constellation in the face of the Russian war of aggression against his country and called for reform of the highest body of the United Nations. In the past, Kiev had doubted that Russia had legally taken over the permanent seat on the Security Council as the successor of the Soviet Union. In addition to Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and China are permanent council members with veto rights. Only the day before, a five-month-old baby was killed by Russian artillery fire, now the aggressor takes over the presidency of the Uno Security Council, Selenskyy criticized in his evening video address on Saturday: ""It is hardly conceivable what better demonstrates the complete bankruptcy of such institutions.""The Presidency of the Security Council rotates monthly in alphabetical order between the Member States, with the ten non-permanent members taking their turn, in addition to the five permanent members. Most recently, Russia held the presidency in February 2022 – when it invaded neighbouring Ukraine. In order to better retaliate the Russian attackers, Ukraine apparently ordered 100 new KTO Rosomak wheeled tanks in Poland. According to the news agency PAP, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this on Saturday during a visit to Rosomak, a manufacturer in Siemianowice Śląskie, Upper Silesia. He was appointed by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Schmyhal personally, according to the liberal conservative politician. The mission was financed with EU money for Poland and US support payments to Ukraine, it said. But the opposite side is also further upgrading. According to its own statements, Russia has increased its ammunition production many times. 'This concerns both ordinary and high-precision ammunition,' said Defense Minister Sergei Schoigu at a meeting of the General Staff on Saturday. In addition, the increase in production will continue to be achieved. More than a year after the war, both Ukraine and Russia are struggling with ammunition shortages. The West, on whose supplies Ukrainian national defense is dependent, is also trying to expand its production. Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has already asked the local arms industry to produce more weapons and ammunition months ago. The companies work in the multi-shift system to meet the military's requirements. Read more here: The Great Ammunition Deficit Ukrainian Ambassador Oleksky Makeyev strongly criticised the call of former high-ranking SPD politicians and trade unionists for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. ""This appeal for peace is not a April joke. This is pure cynicism against the numerous victims of Russian aggression,"" said Makeyev of the German press agency dpa. He only had one goal: »To conceal Russia's crimes and accordingly the responsibility of the Russian regime«. In the face of the brutal Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the only possible appeal for peace was to: »Mr. Putin, withdraw your troops from the entire Ukrainian territory immediately!« The appeal entitled »To create peace!« was initiated by historian Peter Brandt, a son of former Chancellor Willy Brandt, together with Reiner Hoffmann, former head of the German Trade Union Confederation ( DGB ) and former SPD member Michael Müller. In this report, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) is called upon to win the countries of Brazil, China, India and Indonesia together with France for mediation: ""This would be a necessary step to end the killing and explore peace possibilities. Only then can the path to a common security order in Europe be paved.""The signatories include ex-EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen, former Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse and former SPD chairman Andrea Ypsilanti. Ukraine has also imposed further sanctions against persons and companies from Russia and against a company in Ukrainian territory occupied by Russians. On Saturday, President Selenskyy issued several black lists of hundreds of companies, organizations and individuals who were said to have supported the Russian war of aggression. The penalties are in most cases applicable for a period of ten years. The main concerns are directors of arms companies and military research institutions. This sector is also particularly important for companies. However, sanctions were also imposed on the Russian Ministry of Finance and the Federation Council – the upper house of the Russian parliament. Among the most prominent names on the list are the wife and son of Russia's ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, Svetlana and Ilya.",2023-04-02 10:26:09,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/91cd58fd-b66d-4c7c-be18-241e7645c40d_w948_r1.778_fpx43_fpy49.jpg,,,6.0

Mr Di Simine, Milan has already exceeded the EU limit values for fine dust on almost 30 days, according to the IQ Air platform. 35 exceedances per year are permitted. According to the side, Milan is thus the most dirty metropolis in Europe. Is your city sinking in smog? It really doesn't look good at the moment. But the situation is often much worse in smaller cities in Lombardy such as Cremona or Mantua. IQ Air doesn't measure there. Air quality has been a problem for years on end of the Po level. There are several reasons why it is so bad. Born in 1967, he is a PhD in Food Biologist. He was long-time chairman of »Legambiente« in Lombardy, the association is the largest environmental protection organization in Italy. Today Di Simine is an expert in soil policy and head of the scientific committee. He is considered one of the most famous representatives of the organization. Which are these? On the one hand, traffic has increased significantly since the end of the pandemic. This ensures a large part of the nitrogen dioxide load. Italy is a country with a high car density anyway. Industrial enterprises are also running at full speed again, here in northern Italy lies the economic center of the country. On the other hand, we have also been experiencing the effects of drought for two years. What do you mean? The rain would normally filter many particles from the air and bring them to the ground. But we miss him. We are already experiencing the second year with extreme drought. In addition, we experience a special feature every winter, the so-called thermal inversion. This means that the lower air layers on the ground are colder than the upper ones, the air no longer circulates. This means that exhaust gases, smog and pollutants remain on the ground even longer, the air becomes more dirty. Does geographical proximity to the Alps also matter? Yes, the mountains often seem like a wall. Many car companies are located here in the north of Italy, there are a lot of people living here who commute by car every day, but there is also a lot of agriculture. All of this is available individually in other places in Europe. In Germany, cars are also being built, and there are also many cows in the Netherlands or France. But hardly any European region has all this together and even so close to a mountain range. We have to face it. In times of climate change, we cannot continue like this for long. Italian climate strike by Fridays for Future in Rome: »We can't continue this way for long« Is the political leaders aware of this situation? I'm an environmentalist. I am convinced that far too little is being done. But I must acknowledge that progress is being made in and around Milan. The pace of traffic was reduced in many places in the city centre. New cycle paths were created in the pandemic. There is already a city toll, but only for a small area. Temporary driving bans and speed limits to 30 km/h in some areas have also helped, but they are not valid enough. Every year in Milan alone, about 1500 people die from dirty air. More will get sick. Many know that. But what is being done is not enough in the beginning. Agriculture in particular is still completely spared. How could you do it better? Food management has become an obsession in Italy. We are rightly proud of our food. But we should not destroy our environment for this. Much of what is produced in Lombardy is mass goods for export. Do you know what Gran Padano and Parmesan have to do with air pollution in northern Italy? Climate-friendly cheese: »Massware for export« Tell me. Both cheeses need a lot of milk, for which it needs many animals. As long as they are mass products, the dairies and farmers must produce a lot of them to live on. They fertilize the soil to grow feed, their livestock provide mass ammonia, which is a precursor of fine dust. All so that you can shop in Germany as cheaply and thoughtlessly as possible. Should we not eat Italian cheese to protect the climate? You don't have to give up Parmesan to improve the air in Milan, but less of it would actually be helpful. I want a livestock farming based on wine growing. 30 years ago we produced here as cheaply as possible for the mass. Today Italian wine is again an appreciated food. The winegrowers produce less today, but they even earn more than they used to. Nevertheless, everyone can still afford a glass of Pinot Grigio. Just not so thoughtless anymore. That's the way it should be with our cheese. The rules for Parmesan are strict. The cows whose milk is used for this purpose must only be fed with hay and grass. In contrast, other cheeses often use soya, which is imported cheaply from South America and has a worse environmental balance in several respects. So if you want to protect the climate and the air, you might want to eat Parmesan. Traffic chaos in the car town of Turin: »Once again the symbol of freedom« We wanted to talk about air pollution in Milan. How do you experience the situation there? We're facing a big step backwards. Many people do not want to restrict themselves further. They suffer from the many crises of our time, and because of the gentrification, many people in Milan can no longer afford to live in today. The gap between the centre and the suburbs is widening. Some politicians use this and suddenly fight symbolically for the car. It is the symbol of freedom again. We are still far from the target. Actually, you should eliminate as many parking spaces as possible in Milan. Today you can really park anywhere in the city. As long as that's the case, people come hit every day. The cycle paths are not of much use. Many are not connected anyway. Do you have a solution for this problem? Well. A consistent speed limit of 30 km/h would be good, and this is currently being discussed. And more trains and S-Bahns. Life is supposed to be better and healthier, difficult enough it is already.

38,Vorsteher des Kiewer Höhlenklosters für zwei Monate unter Hausarrest,https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/ukraine-vorsteher-des-kiewer-hoehlenklosters-fuer-zwei-monate-unter-hausarrest-a-9723a3fd-d719-480a-bf9f-9ec9a097069b,"A Ukrainian court has placed the head of the well-known Kiev cave monastery, Pavlo, under house arrest for two months. The Ukrainian Orthodox clergyman was suspected of having fueled religious disputes and justified the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Ukrainian media reported from the courtroom. Pawlo must wear electronic shackles. He is forbidden to contact believers. The 61-year-old denies the allegations and speaks of a political trial. The background is disputes over the use of the cave monastery and the position of the Ukrainian Orthodox church in the country in general. The church was under the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate until the beginning of the war. Although she renounced the Patriarchate after the conflict began, the political leadership in Kiev continues to suspect the espionage of Moscow. In Kiev, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which is independent of Moscow, was founded in 2018. In this context, the state of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has now also withdrawn the right of use for the cave monastery. The monks living there refuse to take off their clothes. A court case is under way. Believers protest in front of the cave monastery At least Metropolitan Pawlo must now leave the monastery. In the morning, the police had searched the monastery's head's house on the premises. The priest must, however, be placed under his registration address. This one's not in the monastery. After the raid, dozens of believers protested in front of the cave monastery. The assembled, including clergymen, had religious symbols and prayed. A small group of pro-Ukrainian activists opposed the protest of the faithful. They waved flags in the national colors.",2023-04-01 22:49:47,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/d37a73a9-0001-0004-0000-000001369281_w948_r1.778_fpx51_fpy60.jpg,,,8.0
