0,Heinrich-Mann-Preis für György Dalos: Gegner der Systeme,https://taz.de/Heinrich-Mann-Preis-fuer-Gyoergy-Dalos/!5925042/,"In the letter György Dalos, Hungary's transformation from communism to illiberal democracy is reflected. Now he got the Heinrich Mann Prize. The writer György Dalos 2017 ""For, against and without communism: The title under which he published his memories in 2019 refers to an ideologically moving life. Always a piece ahead of real change, Dalos also reflects the recent history of his home country, about which he has repeatedly written in novels and essays. Now Dalos was awarded the award, which was handed to him on Tuesday evening at the Academy of Arts (AdK); in Berlin, where the 79-year-old has lived for many years. Dalos, born in Budapest in 1943, grew up in poverty, hunger as a constant companion. He said to the German radio that he had made him a victim of communism when he was given enough food in a state lung sanatorium for the first time. Dalos studied history in Moscow, then returned to Hungary, where he was arrested in 1968 for Maoist activity. The Jewish writer was one of the founders of the Hungarian opposition movement, with a ban on his profession. No Coquettishness Unlike many West German intellectuals, Dalos never coquetted with his ""maoist confusions"", says writer Marko Martin, who holds the laudation in the AdK on Dalos. He also tells of his prison days and hunger strike with precision, without exaggeration, always with ""the saving side-stroke on the absurd detail"". The Heinrich Mann Prize is awarded to Dalos for his essayist work, but without the literature, Martin says, he is not the first to explain: ""How about Dalos without Tamás Cohen?, Cohen, the charming novelist from ""Die Seikeschaften"" and ""Der Verhinderspieler"", grows up practically without parents like Dalos. Politically instructed by his party-faithful uncle Dani, he first gets together with him when he is working for a school friend. His father was an officer under the authoritarian Admiral Miklós Horthy, who was responsible for the decree of anti-Jewish laws in Hungary and thus ultimately for the expulsion of the Jews from the country. Like Dalos, Cohen later belongs to the opposition and eventually emigrates to West Berlin. "" The company Tamás Cohen is surrounded by a broken society,"" Martin says. Dalos uses similar words today. In his short thank-you speech, he speaks of a ""world out of the way in which he lives"", meaning ""the war of destruction, which was attenuated as a military operation,"" Russia against Ukraine. In Hungary, the relationship with the head of government of the successor state of the Soviet Union is maintained. Gergely Gulyás, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's spokesman for government, recently said that Hungary would ignore the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court against Vladimir Putin, betraying this Hungarian territory. The European Union also refrained from placing Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, on the sanction list, as Hungary protested. Dalos, who openly calls the Hungarian government illiberal, wrote a book about the ""Orbán"" system last year. Other texts of the writer and historian the Russian German or the Tsar family Romanov. It is a pity that texts from Dalos are not read this evening, but are remembered only by the name of the prize, with an excerpt from Heinrich Mann's ""Professor Unrat"" written by the author. The forced withdrawal from the Academy of Arts in 1933 is remembered by the writer and vice president of the AdK, Kathrin Röggla, in a welcoming speech. Professor Unrat György Dalos has a special relationship with Mann's ""Professor Unrat"". Just started, the novel was immediately taken away from him when his geography teacher caught him reading in class, he tells. Years later he got in touch with the material again when he worked on a biography of Marlene Dietrich, who played the leading role in the UFA novel ""Der blaue Engel"" (The Blue Angel). The book was never published. The publisher, says Dalos, broke shortly before.",2023-03-30 07:32:00,https://taz.de/picture/6179872/948/32499005-1.jpeg,taz,"['entertainment', 'environment']"
