They demanded, among other things, affordable housing and more social housing. ""Living: a right for all"" or ""A right or a privilege?"" was written on the banners of the demonstrators. They demanded a constitutional right to a home for everyone, as one of the associations said, who had called for the demonstrations. ""I live in constant fear that my landlord will announce a brutal rent increase,"" said Ana Reis da Silva, a 32-year-old lawyer who told me that she has been living in the Portuguese capital for about ten years. ""Rentes must remain affordable,"" demanded the 72-year-old retired Martinho Faias Parreira. He lives in a social housing in Lisbon, whose rent has risen sharply in recent years. 35-year-old illustrator Diogo Guerra said that he hears every day from people affected by the crisis: ""People who work and are homeless or who have to move out because their apartment is made a place of accommodation for tourists.""Lisbon is a popular place of residence for so-called digital nomads, i.e. people who can work from anywhere. In 2022, the city ranked one of the »Nomad List«, a ranking of the best cities for digital nomads worldwide. Last week, the Portuguese left government had decided to lease vacant properties in a controversial form. This is supposed to help fight housing shortages. The government of Prime Minister António Costa announced that forced rental would be possible if an apartment remained uninhabited for more than two years. According to official estimates, the country has over 700,000 vacant residential properties with a population of over 10,3 million. The measure was part of the ""Mais Habitaçao"" programme, which was announced in February and now approved by the Council of Ministers. Another government measure is a stop to the granting of so-called golden visas, which give rich investors a right of residence. This is intended to reduce the real estate speculation. According to the European Statistical Authority Eurostat, the purchase price of real estate in Portugal increased by more than 75 percent between 2010 and 2022, while rents increased by almost 25 percent. According to official data, more than half of the workers in the country earned less than 1000 euros per month last year, the minimum wage is 760 euros. Portugal is one of the poorest countries in Western Europe. At the same time, the average rent in Lisbon is 1350 euros per month, as an investigation of the housing portals Imovirtual showed.",2023-04-02 12:18:26,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/50fb7a62-4708-47d1-a775-8b3c0bf375b0_w948_r1.778_fpx57_fpy37.jpg

While Russia has lost up to 200,000 armed forces from injuries or death a year ago since the beginning of the war, a large number of them are due to causes other than the actual fighting, the British Ministry of Defense reported on intelligence findings. ""Russian commanders consider the widespread abuse of alcohol to be particularly detrimental to the effectiveness of the fighting.""At the beginning of the week, a Russian telegram news channel reported that there was an ""extremely high"" number of incidents, crimes and deaths related to alcohol consumption among the armed forces, it was said. Strong drinking was widespread in Russian society and accepted as a tacitly accepted part of military life, even in combat missions. Other major causes of non-combat losses were probably poor training in weapons, traffic accidents and damage caused by climatic conditions such as undercooling. Since the beginning of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the British Ministry of Defense has published daily updates on the war. The British government is therefore seeking to oppose both Russian representation and allies in the fight against intelligence.

In the campaign final sprint, she focused on traditional social democratic issues: Marin personally still has a very loyal supporter. Her »fanbase« never resented her for these recordings either: the »party video«, which was leaked last August, caused a lot of media attention, and the Prime Minister had to deal with a lot of critical questions – but for many followers, even worldwide, dance moves and Marin's presence in the social media only confirmed her image as the »coolest head of state«. Nevertheless, this man managed to bring his party Kokoomus, the National Collection Party, into a tight leadership position in the survey values. Petteri Orpo is considered a rather pale figure. His message to the voters who are faced with a recession is therefore scarce: then there is Riikka Purra, who is also well-informed in the survey values. Although she has put her party of the True Finns somewhat more in the political center, she nevertheless contested the election campaign with the topics popular for the right-wing populists: One topic where there are virtually no differences of opinion between the centre-left coalition and the opposition is the way to NATO. After Turkey has recently agreed to Finland's accession to NATO, this step will be followed soon. Then maybe under another leadership. The current Minister of Defence showed himself at least deeply relaxed in his view of the future with this video on Twitter. His successor will also be elected in the Sunday election. And for Sanna Marin, who took a very clear position, especially in the Ukraine war, it says that in the event of an electoral defeat, the candidacy for an EU top office in Brussels could soon be held.",2023-04-02 10:27:51,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 180 101' width='180' height='101' %3E%3C/svg%3E"

The organisation Presidium Network wrote in the Twitter short message service, working closely with the families of two of the detained. The British Foreign Ministry said it was working on ""making consular contact with British nationals detained in Afghanistan"". Two of the prisoners have been in the Taliban's custody since January, and the duration of the third arrest was initially unclear. According to media reports, men are a medical doctor working for an aid organization and the manager of a housing facility for development workers in Kabul. The third man is said to be a traveller known on the YouTube video platform. He became known as a »danger tourist« with his travels to crisis areas and caused controversy. The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not confirm the details of British nationals. Presidium Network asked the Taliban on Twitter to release the men. Your arrest is probably due to a misunderstanding. Scott Richards of Presidium Network told Sky News that according to his organization's findings, men were ""in good shape"" and were well treated, that there was no evidence of torture or other abuse.",2023-04-02 09:09:42,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/98ee4240-1b63-47cd-889c-dc5de1c5075c_w948_r1.778_fpx68.65_fpy54.97.jpg

In polls, three parties were almost the same in advance: the conservative National Assembly party of former Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo went on to vote as a slight favorite. They recently saw polls only minimally before the right-wing populist party The Finns and the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Sanna Marin. Until 8 p.m. (local time) the polling stations in the northernmost country of the EU are open. Immediately thereafter, a first trend based on early votes should be published. A preliminary final result could be established around midnight on the night of Monday. The 37-year-old Marin has been Finnish Prime Minister since the end of 2019. It leads a center-left coalition of five parties. She was the youngest head of government in the world when she took office. Even then, the Social Democrats were only very marginally the strongest force in the parliamentary elections. Those who ultimately become the strongest force were completely open before the election Sunday: Orpos Conservatives came to 19.8 percent of the votes in the last pre-election survey of the Finnish radio station Yle, the Finn Party for its chairman Riikka Purra to 19.5 percent and Marin's Social Democrats to 18.7 percent. The leader of the party with the most votes is traditionally the first to have the chance to form a new government in Finland. However, long and tough coalition negotiations are expected, as several parties have excluded cooperation with the right-wing populists. For a majority, the winner is likely to depend on another of the major parties and at least one of the medium-sized and smaller parties.",2023-04-02 08:54:03,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/42e756d2-65e3-437c-97b1-80ddcb3579f4_w948_r1.778_fpx49_fpy27.jpg

Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyy spoke of an ""absurd and destructive"" constellation in the face of the Russian war of aggression against his country and called for reform of the highest body of the United Nations. In the past, Kiev had doubted that Russia had legally taken over the permanent seat on the Security Council as the successor of the Soviet Union. In addition to Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France and China are permanent council members with veto rights. Only the day before, a five-month-old baby was killed by Russian artillery fire, now the aggressor takes over the presidency of the Uno Security Council, Selenskyy criticized in his evening video address on Saturday: ""It is hardly conceivable what better demonstrates the complete bankruptcy of such institutions.""The Presidency of the Security Council rotates monthly in alphabetical order between the Member States, with the ten non-permanent members taking their turn, in addition to the five permanent members. Most recently, Russia held the presidency in February 2022 – when it invaded neighbouring Ukraine. In order to better retaliate the Russian attackers, Ukraine apparently ordered 100 new KTO Rosomak wheeled tanks in Poland. According to the news agency PAP, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this on Saturday during a visit to Rosomak, a manufacturer in Siemianowice Śląskie, Upper Silesia. He was appointed by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Schmyhal personally, according to the liberal conservative politician. The mission was financed with EU money for Poland and US support payments to Ukraine, it said. But the opposite side is also further upgrading. According to its own statements, Russia has increased its ammunition production many times. 'This concerns both ordinary and high-precision ammunition,' said Defense Minister Sergei Schoigu at a meeting of the General Staff on Saturday. In addition, the increase in production will continue to be achieved. More than a year after the war, both Ukraine and Russia are struggling with ammunition shortages. The West, on whose supplies Ukrainian national defense is dependent, is also trying to expand its production. Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has already asked the local arms industry to produce more weapons and ammunition months ago. The companies work in the multi-shift system to meet the military's requirements. Read more here: The Great Ammunition Deficit Ukrainian Ambassador Oleksky Makeyev strongly criticised the call of former high-ranking SPD politicians and trade unionists for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. ""This appeal for peace is not a April joke. This is pure cynicism against the numerous victims of Russian aggression,"" said Makeyev of the German press agency dpa. He only had one goal: »To conceal Russia's crimes and accordingly the responsibility of the Russian regime«. In the face of the brutal Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the only possible appeal for peace was to: »Mr. Putin, withdraw your troops from the entire Ukrainian territory immediately!« The appeal entitled »To create peace!« was initiated by historian Peter Brandt, a son of former Chancellor Willy Brandt, together with Reiner Hoffmann, former head of the German Trade Union Confederation ( DGB ) and former SPD member Michael Müller. In this report, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) is called upon to win the countries of Brazil, China, India and Indonesia together with France for mediation: ""This would be a necessary step to end the killing and explore peace possibilities. Only then can the path to a common security order in Europe be paved.""The signatories include ex-EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen, former Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse and former SPD chairman Andrea Ypsilanti. Ukraine has also imposed further sanctions against persons and companies from Russia and against a company in Ukrainian territory occupied by Russians. On Saturday, President Selenskyy issued several black lists of hundreds of companies, organizations and individuals who were said to have supported the Russian war of aggression. The penalties are in most cases applicable for a period of ten years. The main concerns are directors of arms companies and military research institutions. This sector is also particularly important for companies. However, sanctions were also imposed on the Russian Ministry of Finance and the Federation Council – the upper house of the Russian parliament. Among the most prominent names on the list are the wife and son of Russia's ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, Svetlana and Ilya.",2023-04-02 10:26:09,https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/91cd58fd-b66d-4c7c-be18-241e7645c40d_w948_r1.778_fpx43_fpy49.jpg

Mr Di Simine, Milan has already exceeded the EU limit values for fine dust on almost 30 days, according to the IQ Air platform. 35 exceedances per year are permitted. According to the side, Milan is thus the most dirty metropolis in Europe. Is your city sinking in smog? It really doesn't look good at the moment. But the situation is often much worse in smaller cities in Lombardy such as Cremona or Mantua. IQ Air doesn't measure there. Air quality has been a problem for years on end of the Po level. There are several reasons why it is so bad. Born in 1967, he is a PhD in Food Biologist. He was long-time chairman of »Legambiente« in Lombardy, the association is the largest environmental protection organization in Italy. Today Di Simine is an expert in soil policy and head of the scientific committee. He is considered one of the most famous representatives of the organization. Which are these? On the one hand, traffic has increased significantly since the end of the pandemic. This ensures a large part of the nitrogen dioxide load. Italy is a country with a high car density anyway. Industrial enterprises are also running at full speed again, here in northern Italy lies the economic center of the country. On the other hand, we have also been experiencing the effects of drought for two years. What do you mean? The rain would normally filter many particles from the air and bring them to the ground. But we miss him. We are already experiencing the second year with extreme drought. In addition, we experience a special feature every winter, the so-called thermal inversion. This means that the lower air layers on the ground are colder than the upper ones, the air no longer circulates. This means that exhaust gases, smog and pollutants remain on the ground even longer, the air becomes more dirty. Does geographical proximity to the Alps also matter? Yes, the mountains often seem like a wall. Many car companies are located here in the north of Italy, there are a lot of people living here who commute by car every day, but there is also a lot of agriculture. All of this is available individually in other places in Europe. In Germany, cars are also being built, and there are also many cows in the Netherlands or France. But hardly any European region has all this together and even so close to a mountain range. We have to face it. In times of climate change, we cannot continue like this for long. Italian climate strike by Fridays for Future in Rome: »We can't continue this way for long« Is the political leaders aware of this situation? I'm an environmentalist. I am convinced that far too little is being done. But I must acknowledge that progress is being made in and around Milan. The pace of traffic was reduced in many places in the city centre. New cycle paths were created in the pandemic. There is already a city toll, but only for a small area. Temporary driving bans and speed limits to 30 km/h in some areas have also helped, but they are not valid enough. Every year in Milan alone, about 1500 people die from dirty air. More will get sick. Many know that. But what is being done is not enough in the beginning. Agriculture in particular is still completely spared. How could you do it better? Food management has become an obsession in Italy. We are rightly proud of our food. But we should not destroy our environment for this. Much of what is produced in Lombardy is mass goods for export. Do you know what Gran Padano and Parmesan have to do with air pollution in northern Italy? Climate-friendly cheese: »Massware for export« Tell me. Both cheeses need a lot of milk, for which it needs many animals. As long as they are mass products, the dairies and farmers must produce a lot of them to live on. They fertilize the soil to grow feed, their livestock provide mass ammonia, which is a precursor of fine dust. All so that you can shop in Germany as cheaply and thoughtlessly as possible. Should we not eat Italian cheese to protect the climate? You don't have to give up Parmesan to improve the air in Milan, but less of it would actually be helpful. I want a livestock farming based on wine growing. 30 years ago we produced here as cheaply as possible for the mass. Today Italian wine is again an appreciated food. The winegrowers produce less today, but they even earn more than they used to. Nevertheless, everyone can still afford a glass of Pinot Grigio. Just not so thoughtless anymore. That's the way it should be with our cheese. The rules for Parmesan are strict. The cows whose milk is used for this purpose must only be fed with hay and grass. In contrast, other cheeses often use soya, which is imported cheaply from South America and has a worse environmental balance in several respects. So if you want to protect the climate and the air, you might want to eat Parmesan. Traffic chaos in the car town of Turin: »Once again the symbol of freedom« We wanted to talk about air pollution in Milan. How do you experience the situation there? We're facing a big step backwards. Many people do not want to restrict themselves further. They suffer from the many crises of our time, and because of the gentrification, many people in Milan can no longer afford to live in today. The gap between the centre and the suburbs is widening. Some politicians use this and suddenly fight symbolically for the car. It is the symbol of freedom again. We are still far from the target. Actually, you should eliminate as many parking spaces as possible in Milan. Today you can really park anywhere in the city. As long as that's the case, people come hit every day. The cycle paths are not of much use. Many are not connected anyway. Do you have a solution for this problem? Well. A consistent speed limit of 30 km/h would be good, and this is currently being discussed. And more trains and S-Bahns. Life is supposed to be better and healthier, difficult enough it is already.

The Ukrainian Orthodox clergyman was suspected of having fueled religious disputes and justified the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Ukrainian media reported from the courtroom. Pawlo must wear electronic shackles. He is forbidden to contact believers. The 61-year-old denies the allegations and speaks of a political trial. The background is disputes over the use of the cave monastery and the position of the Ukrainian Orthodox church in the country in general. The church was under the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate until the beginning of the war. Although she renounced the Patriarchate after the conflict began, the political leadership in Kiev continues to suspect the espionage of Moscow. In Kiev, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which is independent of Moscow, was founded in 2018. In this context, the state of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has now also withdrawn the right of use for the cave monastery. The monks living there refuse to take off their clothes. A court case is under way. Believers protest in front of the cave monastery At least Metropolitan Pawlo must now leave the monastery. In the morning, the police had searched the monastery's head's house on the premises. The priest must, however, be placed under his registration address. This one's not in the monastery. After the raid, dozens of believers protested in front of the cave monastery. The assembled, including clergymen, had religious symbols and prayed.
