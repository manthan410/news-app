0,Stiftung Warentest testet Akku-Rasenmäher: Drei sind „mangelhaft“,https://www.inside-digital.de/news/stiftung-warentest-testet-akku-rasenmaeher-drei-sind-mangelhaft,"Battery lawnmowers are incredibly practical helpers in the garden. No disturbing power cable, no stinking exhaust gases and a pleasantly quiet working method characterize the battery-powered mowers. Disadvantage: They are usually quite expensive apart from offers at Lidl and Aldi. And sometimes they are even deficient in quality. This is the result of a new test by the Stiftung Warentest ( ""test"" edition: 4/2023 ). Three cordless lawnmowers failed with ""deficient"" – including a model from Bosch. Only four out of twelve models tested received a ""good"" one. In the test, battery lawnmowers from different price ranges had to prove what they could do. And of course, how safe they are and how long the supplied battery lasts. It was discovered that the recently tested models can master lawn areas between 200 and 600 square meters with a battery charge. Sounds good, but is sometimes less than promised by manufacturers. The longest time to go was the relatively cheap Metabo RM 36-18 LTX BL 36 (from 156 euros) and the spindle mower Einhell GE-HM 18/38 Li Solo (from 120 euros). And the Bosch Universal Rotak 36-550 (from 319 euros) also impressed in the range test. The cut result of this mower was also consistently good. The safety even rated the testers as very good. The Bosch mower, however, was the only cordless lawnmower to fail in the test with regard to mechanical durability, because it did not last in the shake test. This caused a devaluation and in the final statement for a ""inadequacy"". According to Stiftung Warentest, the Alpina AL1 3820 Li Kit and Einhell Rasarro 36/38 are not recommended. In the Alpina mower, the testers found the probably carcinogenic substance naphthalene in the grip of the catch basket. Equally unpleasant were the testers of the product, which were found in the handle of the Einhell-Mäher, which classified health-threatening plasticizers. In addition, the single-light mower failed through the safety test. Simulated stones ripped holes into the catch basket. In contrast, the test of the Stiftung Warentest was convincing as a test winner with a ""gut"" of the Stihl RMA 443 C. The mower result was best for this battery lawn mower. This mower was also the most expensive in this year's test. Currently it is in the best case to have for 425 euros. The Stiftung Warentest also issued a ""good"" award-winning Stiga Combi 340e Kit (from 329 euros) and the Husqvarna LC 137i (from 399 euros). The single-hell spindle mower, which is convincing in the battery test, also achieved a ""good"" in the final calculation. About our links With these symbols we identify partner links.

1,"Auch AVM, Hue & Sonos betroffen: Diese App stellt den Betrieb ein",https://www.inside-digital.de/news/auch-avm-hue-sonos-betroffen-diese-plattform-stellt-den-betrieb-ein,"The message came out of the blue for the users of the Home Connect Plus smart home platform. ==References== On June 2023, the platform would cease to be a service, and users were informed by e-mail. The app had started with great ambitions and a good concept. One wanted to break up with tens of different apps, which are sometimes necessary for the operation of all smart devices at home. The goal should be to create a link between different manufacturers in an app, thus enabling a smart home where the devices can communicate with each other. The whole thing was done via the app and the cloud servers of Home Connect Plus. In particular, beginners who did not want to struggle with often complicated Raspberry PI solutions were targeted. But now the end. ==References== On June 15, an app will be made available to allow users to download all the data they have provided or created. This could be a list of rooms, automations and free services in addition to personal data. What you should do with the data then remains unclear. The provider says: ""However, we would like to point out that Home Connect Plus automations are specific to the Home Connect Plus app and cannot be used by another Smart Home app. A similar service, Conrad Connect, had already painted the sails some time ago. The only solution that is half-like is the Telekom's smart home system, which has also been relying on an app for networking for some time. However, many components are not supported here. Home Connect Plus had convinced many companies of its system. Since the launch a little less than two years ago, you have been able to connect Sonos and AVM as much as Homematic IP, Hue, Somfy, Gardena and Ledvance. And of course, Bosch and Siemens' household appliances were also present, from their home Connect Plus environment. The own Home Connect app is continued, they told. As to the reasons for the recruitment, it is said that, in view of ""the difficult economic situation,"" it was decided not to continue the investment in Home Connect Plus. It is possible that the introduction of Matter also plays a role in the considerations. The new Matter standard is designed to enable a wide range of devices to be connected offline and thus to create a smart home. But the introduction is currently more difficult than expected. Just now Hue has moved his Matter update.",2023-03-30 11:30:00,,inside-digital,['technology']
2,Spotify: Neue Funktion verärgert unzählige Kunden,https://www.inside-digital.de/news/spotify-neue-funktion-veraergert-unzaehlige-kunden,"The short video app TikTok is incredibly successful. So it is no wonder that other platforms like Instagram or YouTube are increasingly relying on short videos in portrait format. The makers of Spotify have probably followed this trend and thought ""Why should we still show playlists and albums to users of our music app on the start page if we can also present short videos there? However, countless users see this differently and criticism is hailing. Until now, Spotify's homepage was quite functional: Six playlists often belonged to the top and then several elements in changing order. For example, with personalized new releases, playlists to the mood or time of day, events nearby or last belonged playlists. Except for the six playlists at the top, this is all gone. Instead, you can see big videos, so-called canvas, which you know from playing songs. These apply playlists or podcasts that are supposed to fit your own taste. This not only makes much less content available, but also presents them disastrously. Even on the largest smartphone, you can only see a single ""Canvas"" and have to wipe each video individually, as the app stops with each canvas. Normal scrolling as in any other app or website is no longer possible. While the old design has invited you to discover new releases or previously unknown playlists and offer the user a variety of content on one page, the new design wipes you to death with an infinite list of playlists. Other users see this similar. In the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, there are countless reviews with 1 or 2 stars in which users criticize the new design. The new Spotify design has not yet arrived at many users. In a short sample in the office, I am the only one who has already been changed to the new design. I'm afraid you can't turn it off yourself. So let us hope that Spotify takes the criticism of users to heart and stops distribution. Personally, I have been using Spotify in the premium version since 2012 and have since spent a four-digit sum on subscription fees for the service. With the broad integration with Spotify Connect, the excellent music recommendations and the fact that it is a European company, Spotify has always scored my mark. But unlike movies on Netflix, Disney and Co. music is not exclusive. You can listen to the same music with Deezer, Apple Music or one of the countless other providers. → the best Spotify alternatives",2023-03-30 10:00:00,,inside-digital,['technology']
3,iPhone 15: Insider erklärt Apples spannendste Veränderung,https://www.inside-digital.de/news/iphone-15-insider-erklaert-apples-spannendste-veraenderung,"A few weeks ago, the first rendering images of iPhone 15 and 15 Pro appeared. Based on CAD drawings that shell manufacturers use for their products, they gave initial indications of important changes. Since the first model, Apple's smartphone has not only side buttons that normally click as you are used to. A small switch for muting has always been available. Now Leaker ""anonymous-A.S."" spoke with further details in the MacRumors forum. These describe how the new buttons work. The same user had already predicted details about Dynamic Island last year. Remember: Apple allegedly wants to do without traditional buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro. Instead, ""Solid-State-keys"" are to be used. These are not movable, but they still recognize the pressure through your finger. Apple already uses a similar technique in the MacBook. There the trackpad is not movable, only Apple's so-called Taptic Engine provides a vibration inside the device. It feels like it's moving. The home button since iPhone 7 is based on the same idea. This technology is now also to be used for all buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro. However, there were fears that after the device is switched off – for example when the battery is empty – no key movements will be detected. Apple seems to have found a solution here. Various components of Apple's smartphone already work today even when the device is switched off. These include Bluetooth – and ultra-wideband features for the ""Where is?  These functions are to be taken over by a new chip in the iPhone 15 Pro. He is also responsible for the new keys. It also detects a pressure on the switches when the battery is empty or the iPhone 15 Pro is switched off. It is still unclear whether a vibration by the Taptic Engine takes place in the switched off state. Furthermore, it should be able to distinguish between a keystroke and holding a key. Even a variant of 3D Touch should be supported. So it is possible, for example, that a slight taping only slightly increases the volume, while a strong pressure causes large jumps. Apple is currently testing several variants of the new volume control. In addition to simple keypresses for louder and quieter, the movement of a finger is also tried out via the button for control. It is currently unclear which variant Apple will choose at the end. However, this can be controlled by the software, so Apple can adjust it at any time. Another feature since the first hour is, as mentioned above, the small lever to mute. As the leaker writes in the forum, this switch will indeed be missing the iPhone 15 Pro. A new small button should take the place above the volume control. Internally, Apple calls this an action button; the same name as the Apple Watch Ultra. You can add various functions to the Ultra version of the Apple Watch. For example, you can turn the flashlight on and off by pressing it or start a workout. But you can also put your own shortcut here. The possibilities on the iPhone could be much more extensive. In addition to mute, it is conceivable that you can also activate a focus mode by pressing the button. A template of the possibilities is perhaps the operating aid "" Tap on the back side You've been able to find this in the Settings > User Tools > Taping for a long time. What options Apple will offer is currently unknown.",2023-03-30 10:00:00,,inside-digital,['technology']
